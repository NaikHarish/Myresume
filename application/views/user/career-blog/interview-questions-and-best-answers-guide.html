creating a killer resume and cover letter and passing the first round, it is time to face the final challenge:</p><p>Your <strong>job interview</strong>.</p><p>And that <a

We’re going to explain what the HR manager wants to see in you, as well as give you sample answers you could use.</p><p>So, let’s get started!&nbsp;</p><section><h3>1) Tell me something about yourself.</h3><p>How hard can it be to talk about yourself? We do it on a daily basis without much thought to it.</p><p>However, recruitment managers are not looking for your whole life story, your third-grade achievements, or what you had for dinner last night. Instead, <strong>they are looking for a pitch</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is usually the first question asked in an interview, so it acts as your introduction. Make sure your answer is <strong>relevant to the position</strong> you are applying for. What you should be aiming for here is to present yourself as the ideal candidate for the job.</p><p>A good rule of thumb is to structure your talking points as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Briefly introduce yourself:</strong> What’s your name? How long have you been working as [profession]?</li><li>What do you <strong>love</strong> about your job?</li><li>What are your top 2-3 achievements that are <strong>relevant to the job</strong> you’re applying for?</li></ul><p>Now, let’s go through some examples:</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible Answers for "Tell me About Yourself":</h4><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59); color: rgb(48, 61, 70);">Sample Answer 1: </strong></li></ul><p><em>Hey! So, my name is John Doe and I’ve worked as a business analyst for 5+ years in Company X and Company Y.</em></p><p><em>I have some background in data analysis, having studied Information Systems at [Made-Up] University.</em></p><p><em>Throughout my career, I’ve done some pretty impressive stuff (if I do say so myself, haha).&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>For example, at Company X, I led a project for migrating all operations data to a new data warehousing system to cut down on costs. The new solution was a much better fit for our business, which eventually led to savings of up to $200,000 annually.</em></p><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59); color: rgb(48, 61, 70);">Sample Answer 2:</strong></li></ul><p><em>I am Jane Doe, a recent college graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>I have just graduated with honors in Biochemistry. I know my way around a lab and have had multiple opportunities to put my knowledge into practice as a chemistry research assistant.</em></p><p><em>The lab felt like home, which is why I’d love to work as a lab assistant. I am passionate, hard-working, and extremely responsible. I am also looking forward to putting to practice all the things I learned during my time at university.</em></p></section></section><section><h3>2) How did you hear about this position?</h3><p>Although at first glance this might seem like a straightforward question, you should grab any opportunity you can to <strong>show your interest</strong> in the company.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you haven’t been continuously refreshing the company’s website for job listings, make it seem like you have (in a professional way, of course). Show <strong>excitement</strong> and curiosity.</p><p>If someone inside the company told you about the position or <strong>recommended</strong> that you apply, definitely make sure to mention that.</p><p>You’ll have a much better chance at getting hired if someone credible can vouch for your skills.</p><p>So, mention his/her name and his/her position inside the company and give their reasoning for inviting or recommending you to apply for the position. Tell the hiring managers what excites you about the job opportunity or what exactly caught your eye.</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible answers for "How did you hear about this position?":</h4><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59); color: rgb(48, 61, 70);">Sample answer 1:</strong></li></ul><p><em>“I’ve known about [MadeUpTechnologies] for a long time - I’m a big fan of your products. I even own one of your latest phone models!</em></p><p><em>I love the company’s passion for creating super intuitive, beautiful hardware, and I would love to be a part of it.</em></p><p><em>So, when I saw your job ad at [RandomJobBoardWebsite], even though I wasn’t actively looking for a job at the time, I couldn’t help but apply!”</em></p><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59); color: rgb(48, 61, 70);">Sample answer 2:</strong></li></ul><p><em>“I heard from Jim Doe, my old colleague and college friend, that [Company X] was looking for a new sales director. He encouraged me to apply, saying that my experience managing a sales team at&nbsp;[Some Software Company] would be helpful for [Company X].</em></p><p><em>I’ve heard a lot about [Company X] from Jim, and I’m a big fan of the way you do things there. I’ve always wanted to work for a company with a flat organizational structure.”</em></p></section></section><section><h3>3) Why did you decide to apply for this position?</h3><p>Through this question, the interviewers want to assess how passionate you are for the position. And no, the answer isn’t:</p><p><em style="color: rgb(194, 71, 47);">“Well, I’m very passionate about not starving to death.”</em></p><p>Or…</p><p><em style="color: rgb(194, 71, 47);">“Well, I needed the money, and you guys tend to pay a lot.”</em></p><p>What the interviewer is looking for here is to see how passionate you are about the job or the company. After all, job performance is directly linked to job satisfaction. The happier you are about your position at the company, the more productive you’ll be.</p><p>And here’s the kicker - your passion will be very evident during the interview.</p><p>When you’re talking to a person that’s passionate about something, you can pretty much feel them glow as they talk. And if you’re an HR manager who’s interviewed hundreds of people, this is a very good sign to hire the candidate.</p><p>So, use this knowledge to your advantage.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked this question, your answer should include 2 things:</p><ol><li>What motivated you to apply for this position, <strong>specifically</strong>.</li><li>Why this company? Have you heard of them before?</li></ol><section class="list-pos"><h4>Sample Answer 1:</h4><p><em>I’m very passionate about sustainability and renewable energy. In fact, I minored in Environmental Science at [XYZ University].</em></p><p><em>I’ve always wanted to put my engineering degree to a good cause - and the position as a Sustainability Coordinator&nbsp;at [Company XYZ] is just the right thing.</em></p><p><em>I’ve been following your company for the past few years, and I love how you’re changing the renewable energy landscape in America.&nbsp;</em></p></section><p>Keep in mind, though, that if you don’t know much about the company or the position - that’s OK too. Just be honest and show your passion for the job. However, it’s always better to do your homework before going to an interview..</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible answer 2:</h4><p>I’ve always wanted to get into marketing. Having done promotional jobs here and there, I never had an opportunity to do something more serious.</p><p>I do believe, though, that I have just the right skills to get started: copywriting, basic photoshop, and of course, lots of creativity.</p><p>So, I thought that an internship at [Company X] would be an awesome start to my career in marketing.</p></section><p><em>Want to find more samples answers to this question? Check out our article on 10+ best answers to “</em><a href="why-do-you-want-to-work-here.html"><em>Why do you want to work here?</em></a><em>”</em></p></section><section><h3>4) What are your biggest strengths?</h3><p>There are two answers you could go for here: what your actual strengths are, and what you think the hiring manager or HR representative wants to hear. We would most certainly suggest you go with the first answer.&nbsp;</p><p>For this question, you would want to narrow your answer down to <strong>at most three strengths</strong>. Pick 1 or 2 skills that would help you really excel at the job, and 1 or 2 personal (more or less unrelated) skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Not sure which ones are your top strengths? Check out the table below to learn which one’s perfect for your field:</p><div class="art-img"><img src="../../d.novoresume.com/images/blogs/fcb0a6b0-21db-11e8-a346-53887de6ab46/top-strengths-for-different-fields.png" alt="top strengths for different fields"/></div><p>After picking your strengths, <strong>back it up with a situation</strong> or story that shows how you have used it to benefit you on the job.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, words are just that - words. The HR can’t know whether your “natural leadership” is an actual strength, or just means that you were super active in your high school class.</p><p>As you probably already know, this is one of the most common interview questions out there, so make sure you’re prepared for it before facing the HR manager!</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible answers:</h4><ul><li><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample Answer 1:</span></li></ul><p><em>My biggest strength is that I’m good at picking up new skills. I’ve worked a variety of different odd jobs - things like working as a waiter, house-keeper, cook, and a lot more (as you’ve probably seen on my resume).</em></p><p><em>For most of those jobs, I ended up picking up all the needed skills within 1 or 2 weeks (with basically no previous experience).&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>So, I’m pretty sure while I don’t have any experience as a bartender, I have the right certification, and I believe I can get good at it within a week or two.</em></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Possible answer 2:</span></li></ul><p><em>My biggest strength is that I’m very efficient at working under pressure. No matter the crisis or stress, I can make the right decisions on-the-spot.</em></p><p><em>As an event manager at Company X, we were organizing an IT conference for a client. There were a ton of last-minute hiccups - some speakers canceled and the catering company said they’d be late for the lunch break. On top of that, we were understaffed because 2 of our volunteer organizers got sick and couldn’t show up.</em></p><p><em>At that point, things looked so bleak that we were considering canceling the event or postponing it. Instead, I took the initiative in my hands and sorted through the problems one by one.</em></p></section></section><section><h3>5) What is your biggest weakness?</h3><p>Ah, this is always a tricky one!&nbsp;</p><p>After all, you don’t want to mention your flaws during an interview, so it’s guaranteed to be a tough question.</p><p>The trick to answering this one is realizing that the interviewers don’t expect you to be perfect. Everyone has flaws, weaknesses, and things to improve on.</p><p>When asking this question, the HR manager is actually seeking to learn:</p><ul><li>Whether you have the right skill s for the job. If you’re applying for the position of a server in a busy restaurant, and you say your biggest weakness is performing under pressure, then you’re definitely not getting a call back.</li><li>If you’re self-aware and really know what your sticking points are.</li></ul><p>And NO: <strong>fake humble-brag</strong> weaknesses don’t count as weaknesses. You can’t just say that your biggest weakness is that you work too hard, or that you’re a perfectionist.</p><p>The key here is to mention a weakness that’s real, but not something that would get in the way of you doing your job. You wouldn’t want to say you’re bad at math if you’re applying for an accountant position, would you</p><p>It’s also good practice to mention how <strong>you are working towards</strong> overcoming this weakness and realizing how it affects you negatively. If you can, <strong>just balance it with a positive</strong> side effect: treat it like two sides of the same coin.</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible answers:</h4><ul><li><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample answer 1:</span></li></ul><p><em>My biggest weakness has always been my communication skills. I’ve been pretty shy and anxious as a kid. Over the years, however, I’ve been really working on the issue.</em></p><p><em>At this stage, I’m much better than I’ve ever been, but I’m still far from perfect.</em></p><p><em>This, however, won’t have any impact on my job as a programmer. Despite lacking communication skills, I’m very good at working in a team.</em></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample answer 2:</span></li></ul><p><em>Well, as a recent graduate, I’d say my biggest weakness is the lack of real-life work experience.</em></p><p><em>While I’ve worked on a dozen software projects in the university, I don’t have the experience of working in a fully agile environment with an experienced team.</em></p><p><em>I am, however, willing to do my best and catch up as fast as I can.</em></p></section><p><em>Looking for more samples answers about your </em><a href="what-are-your-strengths-and-weaknesses-interview-questions.html"><em>strengths and weaknesses</em></a><em>? Check out our full guide!</em></p></section><section><h3>6) What do you know about this company/organization?</h3><p>A quick search in the “About” page of the company/organization you are applying for should be enough, right? Well, yes and no.&nbsp;</p><p>Think of this as an open-ended question. There’s no real wrong answer here, other than:</p><section class="list-neg"><h4>Incorrect Example</h4><p><em>I don’t know anything about this organization. In fact, how did I end up here? Can you guys call me a cab real quick?</em></p></section><p><strong>However</strong>, the more you actually know about the company, the better your chances of getting hired.</p><p>Imagine 2 equally competent candidates:</p><ol><li>One who doesn’t particularly care much about your company, and is only applying because they know you pay good salaries</li><li>Another who’s been following your company blog for ages, loves your product, and has several friends already working in the company</li></ol><p>Which one would you pick? Exactly, the second one!</p><p>So, with this job interview question, you want to convince the recruiter that you’re the candidate #2.</p><p>Now, how do you do that? Well, a rule of thumb here is to do some Googling before the interview and learn the following about the company:</p><ul><li>What does their product or service do?</li><li>What impact does the product / service have?</li><li>What’s the company culture like?</li><li>What are the latest news about the company? How are they performing?</li><li>...And pretty much whatever other type of info you can dig up.</li></ul><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible answers:</h4><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample Answer 1:</strong></li></ul><p>I hadn’t heard about you until recently, actually.

You probably have a very good reason for it.</p><p>The interviewer, however, will definitely ask about it, and you should answer adequately.</p><p>There’s no secret sauce to answering this question, just let the recruiter know about your situation, whatever that may be:</p><ul><li>Maternity leave</li><li>Health issues</li><li>Caring for a sick family member</li><li>Time off to pursue further education</li><li>Relocating to a different city</li><li>Working on a personal project</li></ul><p>Whichever the case may be, just explain the situation in brief and move on.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind, however, is that if you were laid off at work, or you quit and had trouble getting a new job, you should be very subtle about it.</p><p>If the interviewer knows that you’re struggling to find a job, you’re going to give them the upper hand in salary negotiations.</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible answers:</h4><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample Answer 1:</strong></li></ul><p><em>“I had a baby and had to take maternity leave.”</em></p><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample Answer 2:</strong></li></ul><p><em>“My father was sick, so I had to be the one to take care of him full-time over a few months.”</em></p></section></section><section><h3>6) Why were you fired?</h3><p>Now this is a tough one.</p><p>Getting fired is pretty much never good.</p><p>Keep in mind that we’re talking about getting fired, not getting laid off. There’s a huge difference between the two:</p><ul><li><strong>Getting laid off</strong> means that you got let go for something that had nothing to do with your competence. <em>I.e. budget cuts, company down-sizing, etc.</em></li><li><strong>Getting fired</strong>, on the other hand, means that you got let go for a reasonable cause. And chances are, it’s probably your fault.</li></ul><p>If you got fired and the interviewer asks you about it, you should be honest. After all, they can easily check-in with your previous employer.</p><p>Your best shot here is to be critical about your mistakes, and explain what you’ve done to improve.</p><section class="list-neg"><h4>Incorrect example:</h4><p><em>“None of it was my fault. My boss is a total tool, and he hates me for no real reason. He yelled at me for no real reason!”</em></p><p><em>In the example above, the interviewee gets defensive. That’s a pretty huge red flag for the HR manager.</em></p><p><em>Instead, try saying something that shows that you’re aware of your mistakes.”</em></p></section><section class="list-pos"><h4>Correct example:</h4><p><em>“The main fault was in miscommunication. The interviewer was unclear about the job responsibilities - from what I understood, they were looking for a senior-level marketer to oversee their email marketing operations.</em></p><p><em>At the end of the day, though, it turned out that the company was looking to experiment with email marketing, and specifically for someone to set it up from scratch.</em></p><p><em>While I did my best to deliver, in the end it turned out that their niche doesn’t actually need email marketing. This was against the management’s vision, so that decided to let me go.”</em></p></section></section><section><h3>7) How do you feel about working weekends or late hours?</h3><p>You’re gonna get asked this question in one of the following 2 cases:</p><p><strong>1) You’re applying for a job that requires working odd hours.</strong></p><p>In this case, your answer is pretty straightforward - since you’re applying for such a job, you probably don’t have any problems working odd hours.</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Sample answer:</h4><p><em>“Sure! I’m OK with working late hours or weekends, as long as you let me know about it at least a few days in advance.”</em></p></section><p><strong>2) You’re applying for just about any other type of job.</strong></p><p>Now, you should look at this as a red flag. Is the employer just checking your dedication, or are they looking for someone that’s going to work 24/7 with no overtime pay?</p><p>In this case, ask them to clarify what they mean.</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Sample answer:</h4><p><em>“Given enough warning, sure. Is that something I’ll be required to do often? Do you offer overtime pay for this kind of situation?”</em></p></section></section><section><h3>8) How would your boss or coworkers describe you?</h3><p>This question is pretty much the same as “what are your greatest strengths,” the only difference is that it should be from the point of view from your boss or coworkers.</p><p>Here, you want to focus on your traits and achievements that you’ve previously been praised for (After all, the interviewer might ask for a reference!).</p><p>There are at least 2 ways to answer this question:</p><p><strong>1) Describe a specific situation where you excelled at work (and received praise from your boss and coworkers)</strong></p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Sample Answer</h4><p><em>“They’d say I’m super hard working. During my weekend-off, not one, but three of my coworkers got sick, and I had to spot for them.</em></p><p><em>The weekend was peak season in Nantucket, so the restaurant was getting seriously overwhelmed.&nbsp;All of a sudden, we went from being very prepared for the season, to complete panic.</em></p><p><em>Had to jump between serving, bussing, and line-cooking, but overall, managed to survive through the weekend successfully.”</em></p></section><p><strong>2) Quote a performance review</strong></p><p>If you’ve previously worked in an office job, you’re probably all too familiar with these.</p><p>Did your boss give you a glowing performance review? Make sure to mention it here!</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Sample answer:</h4><p><em>“Well, in my last performance review in September, my boss described me as someone who takes initiative.</em></p><p><em>My position as a PR manager involves constantly keeping track of our clients brand reputation, and if something goes wrong, dealing with it as fast as possible.</em></p><p><em>In a lot of cases, you need to be very proactive - if you wait for your entire team to have a meeting on how to deal with the issue, it might already be too late.</em></p><p><em>There were 4-5 different situations where I had to take charge and react to problems literally the moment they arose, whether it was during my work hours, or not.”</em></p></section></section><section><h3>9) Do you have any serious medical conditions?</h3><p>When asking this question, the interviewer wants to learn if you have any medical conditions that could impair your ability to do the job correctly.</p><p>In most cases, you’re not obliged to give an answer. If you do have a health condition, and it doesn’t have anything to do with your career, you can simply choose not to answer, or to say “No.”</p><p>However, you might want to disclose anything that could potentially have an impact on how you perform.</p><p>For example, if the job requires you to lift heavy boxes, for example, and you’re not able to do so because of a condition, you should let the HR manager know.</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible answers:</h4><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">[Sample Answer 1]</strong></li></ul><p><em>“I don’t have any serious medical conditions”</em></p><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">[Sample answer 2]</strong></li></ul><p><em>“I’m unable to lift heavy objects because of issues with my back, but it won’t have any impact on how I perform at an office job”</em></p></section></section><section><h3>10) What would your first 30, 60, or 90 days look like in this role?</h3><p>If you’re applying for a senior or leadership role, you’re probably going to get asked this question.</p><p>Chances are, at this stage of the interview, you already know a lot about your future position and the company.</p><p>Now, it’s time to show off your knowledge in your field, and explain how you’re going to start making things happen at the company.</p><p>So, here’s how to answer the question:</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>For the first 30 days:</h4><p>You’re probably going to need to get to know the company first. You’re going to be learning as much as possible, including information on:</p><ul><li>What does the company do?</li><li>What are the key processes?</li><li>What does your department do?</li><li>What are the current problems and challenges?</li><li>Where can you help?</li></ul></section><section class="list-pos"><h4>Then, during the 60 days:</h4><p>You’ll start start making things happen. From all the info you gathered, suggest a handful (3 to 5) initiatives you could take on:</p><ul><li>You’d audit the company email marketing strategy and suggest improvements</li><li>You’ll help come up with better ad copies for Facebook marketing</li><li>You’ll help the team with their ongoing marketing initiatives</li></ul></section><section class="list-pos"><h4>Within the first 90 days:</h4><p>You’re already have started making an impact. Describe several things you think are going to be functioning better:</p><ul><li>Online ads are going to be performing better by 10-20%</li><li>Email marketing operations are going to be more streamlined, taking significantly less manpower</li></ul></section></section><section><h3>11) Are you a team player?</h3><p>Wherever you’re applying, the answer to this question should be a “Yes!”</p><p>Even if you’re applying for a completely solo role, chances are, you’re still going to have to work in a team <strong>occasionally</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>We’d recommend being very specific about your answer here - don’t just say yes. Give the interviewer an exact example of when you excelled at working with a team.</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible answers:</h4><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample Answer 1:</strong></li></ul><p><em>“I’m much better at working in a team than alone, actually. That’s what I love about working in advertising - everyone has their own specific type of a creative spark, and when you combine it all, magic happens!</em></p><p><em>I’m good at both leading and following in terms of creativity and brainstorming. I’m also super receptive to others ideas, and do my best to help them execute it without nay-saying or criticism.”</em></p><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample Answer 2:</strong></li></ul><p><em>“Yep, definitely. I excel at team-work.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>This one time while working at [Company X], I was assigned to an existing team working on a web application for a business process management company.</em></p><p><em>They were working on a tight deadline, and needed help on the API side.</em></p><p><em>I optimised their development cycles and oversaw a team of three developers while collaborating with the other two dev teams.</em></p><p><em>Everything went pretty well, and we managed to finish the project on time.”</em></p></section></section><section><h3>12) Are you a risk-taker?</h3><p>This one’s pretty tricky, as the answer here depends on your profession and field.</p><p>Ask yourself - is risk-taking a valuable skill for the job?</p><p>If you’re a pilot, for example, the answer should be a strict <em>“No!”</em></p><p>If, on the other hand, you’re a day trader, then risk is an essential part of your job.</p><p>So, depending on how valuable risk is for your job, answer accordingly.</p><p>You could also give a more strategic answer. Let’s say, for example, you work in investment banking. You need to be a risk taker to an extent, but being too risk-friendly might make the entire company go bankrupt.</p><p>The strategy in such a case would be to show that you’re all about <strong>calculated risk</strong>. You’re willing to take chances, but only when the odds are in your favor.</p><p>As with most interview questions, you should give examples of situations where you had to take risks, and what the end-results were.</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible answers:</h4><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample Answer 1:</strong></li></ul><p><em>“Yes, I’m a risk-taker. I believe that to achieve real results, you always need to be willing to take a certain level of risk.</em></p><p><em>Pretty much any marketing initiative you launch is tied to risk. You can plan everything from beginning till the end, but no matter how well you plan it out, things might just not work out.</em></p><p><em>It’s just part of the job - in order to succeed, you need to take launch risky campaigns on a regular basis, and hopefully, one in every 5 is going to bring you massive results.”</em></p><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample Answer 2:</strong></li></ul><p><em>“I’m not a risk-taker, I’m more of a risk-manager. As someone who’s been in finance for years, I can say with a lot of confidence that there’s risk in everything.</em></p><p><em>The most important things are to one, minimize your risks, and two, minimize potential damages if everything goes very, very wrong.</em></p><p><em>While working at Investment Bank X, we had a very interesting policy for investing in new fintech projects. We used to avoid moon-shots, high-tech projects, as well as anything that had an experimental business model.</em></p><p><em>Our strategy was to invest in proven tech. As in, proven product-market fit, business model, etc. In most cases, these were runner up companies. We wouldn’t invest in that one innovative company that was all over the news - we’d instead invest in their latest competitor. More often than not, this ended up being more profitable, and significantly less risky.”</em></p></section></section><section><h3>13) How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?</h3><p>If you’re applying for a high-stress job, you’re guaranteed to get asked this question.</p><p>The aim of this question is to see if you’re the type of person who’d survive working at the job, or fall through the cracks when the first signs of trouble show up.</p><p>Obviously, you wouldn’t answer with the following…</p><p><em style="color: rgb(194, 71, 47);">“Well, I end up having a panic attack, crying, and running away from work.”</em></p><p>Instead, answer as follows…</p><ul><li>Say that yes, you do tend to perform well during stressful situations</li><li>Give 1-2 examples of a situation where you had to perform well under pressure</li></ul><p>Now, let’s go through some real-life examples:</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible answers:</h4><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample Answer 1:</strong></li></ul><p><em>“Though I can’t particularly say I enjoy stressful situations, I AM very good at working under pressure.</em></p><p><em>During chaos and panic, I tend to take a step back, think, plan, and prioritize.</em></p><p><em>For example, there have been times I’ve had to juggle multiple university projects and assignments at the same time. I would break up large assignments into small, individual tasks, and prioritize based on:</em></p><ul><li><em>How fast I could complete each task</em></li><li><em>Figuring out which task would take the longest</em></li><li><em>Which project had the earliest deadline</em></li></ul><p><em>This way, my work became a lot more manageable. The most times I had to experience such situations, the better I performed overall.”</em></p><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample Answer 2:&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><em>“I actually prefer working under pressure. I look at it as a challenge - a situation where I really have to up my game to succeed.</em></p><p><em>As a cook, working under pressure is pretty much part of the job. I’ve been in several situations where the restaurant was understaffed for the occasion. Heck, it’s pretty much a constant thing during peak season.</em></p><p><em>When there’s a ton of orders coming in and we can barely keep up, I tend to get significantly more productive than usual.”</em></p></section></section><section><h3>14) Do you prefer hard work, or smart work?</h3><p>By definition, hard work is when you, well, work hard. It’s when you’re willing to put in a lot of work to get the job done.</p><p>Smart work on the other hand, means doing the work efficiently. If you manage to get the job done in 2 hours instead of 5, with the same end-result, you’re doing smart work.</p><p>Keep in mind, though, that by asking this question, the interviewer is looking to understand what your work ethic is like. Meaning, they’re looking for a healthy combination of both, not just one.</p><p>That is, they want you to be the candidate who not only thinks smartly but works hard as well.&nbsp;</p><p>So, your answer here shouldn’t be one-sided...</p><p><em style="color: rgb(194, 71, 47);">“Oh, I looove smart work. That’s when you come up with what to do, and make other people do it, right?”</em></p><p>Instead, explain how you excel at both:</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Sample answer:</h4><p><em>“I don’t particularly have a preference - I believe that both hard and smart work is important to get the best results.</em></p><p><em>Smart work, on one hand, lets you figure out the best and most efficient way to get things done.</em></p><p><em>Hard work, on the other hand, means that you’ll do the job right. Even if there’s no way to do it smart or efficiently, you’ll be willing to put in long hours of work to get it done.</em></p><p><em>I’m the type that does both.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>For an example of smart for, during my time at [Made Up Corporation], I was in charge of the sales department. As a process improvement initiative, I migrated from an outdated, in-house CRM, to Pipedrive. This improved the department’s productivity by around 20%.</em></p><p><em>On the other hand, the whole migration process took around 3 months of hard work. As the software we were using was outdated, trying to learn how to map and migrate our data was a lot more complicated than we’d expected.”</em></p></section></section><section><h3>15) How quickly do you adapt to new technology?</h3><p>Today, whether you’re applying for a software engineering job, or as a cashier in a supermarket, you’re going to need to use technology at least on some level.</p><p>It’s very common for a company to adopt new tech - new point of service system, self check-out kiosks, customer management software, and whatever else.</p><p>So, you should be able to pick up <strong>new tech ASAP</strong>. Any new change shouldn’t completely disrupt your work.</p><p>So, when answering this question, you should talk about how tech-savvy you are.</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible answers:</h4><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample Answer:&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><em>“I’m pretty tech-savvy. I’ve worked with a lot of different Point of Service systems so far, and have zero difficulties learning how to use new ones.”</em></p><p><em>As a given, I own a PC, have used Office 365, and all the usual stuff.”</em></p><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample Answer 2:</strong></li></ul><p><em>“I’ve always been interested in tech. In fact, I’m the type of person to actively seek out new software to help solve business problems at work.</em></p><p><em>I’ve worked with 3 different Customer Management Software in the past, such as PipeDrive, SalesForce, and Zoho CRM.”</em></p></section></section><section><h3>Do you have any interests outside of work?</h3><p>If the interviewer asks you this question, take it as a good sign!</p><p>It means that they liked your professional background, and now they’re just trying to get to know&nbsp;you and see if you’re a good fit for the company culture.</p><p>It’s pretty hard to go wrong here, unless you’re going to answer something like:</p><p><em style="color: rgb(194, 71, 47);">“I have literally no hobbies.”</em></p><p>or...</p><p><em style="color: rgb(194, 71, 47);">“All I do is play video games all day.”</em></p><p>Just talk about your <a href="hobbies-and-interests-to-put-on-a-resume.html">hobbies and interests</a>, and you’re all set!</p><p>Bonus points if you can mention something that’s also relevant to your job (creative writing if you’re applying for a copywriting job, for example).</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible answers:</h4><ul><li><strong style="background-color: rgb(255, 212, 59);">Sample Answer 1</strong></li></ul><p><em>“I’m a big fan of creative writing.

I like to keep active, as it really helps keep me productive. Over the past 2 years, I’ve done a bit of everything - fencing, archery, hiking, and several other things.”</em></p></section></section><section><h3>17) Do you have any children?/Are you planning on having any children?</h3><p>A lot of companies don’t want to hire someone only for them to go on maternity (or paternity) leave a few months after.</p><p>The thing is, though, asking this question is illegal. Companies are not allowed to discriminate based on family status.</p><p>So, feel free to give a generic answer:</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Possible answers:</h4><p><em>“I don’t have any children, and currently, I’m not planning on having any.”</em></p><p><em>“Currently, my main focus is my career (and not my personal life).”</em></p></section><p>We would, however, recommend reconsidering working at a company that follows legally questionable practices.</p><p>18) What do you think our company/organization could do better?</p><p>Well, this one’s interesting!</p><p>While not too common for most organizations, it’s a favorite amongst tech companies.</p><p>How come? Well, answering this question shows a couple of things…</p><ul><li>That you’re really passionate about the organization, and have done your research</li><li>Are not afraid of giving feedback</li></ul><p>Obviously, you should be very political about your feedback. You can’t just say that:</p><section class="list-neg"><h4>Incorrect example:</h4><p><em>“Well, a lot of things really. I’m not enjoying this interview right here, for example.</em></p><p><em>And your product kinda sucks, no offense. But hey, there’s always room for improvement, am I right?”</em></p></section><p>Instead, you want to show off the research you’ve done. Talk about anything that might seem off about their product or business:</p><section class="list-pos"><h4>Correct example:</h4><p><em>“I actually went through your resume builder before coming to the interview, and found several things that seemed kinda counter-intuitive.</em></p><p><em>Not to say that it’s too hard to understand, or something, but it took me a while to figure out some stuff.</em></p><p><em>If you want, I can open up my laptop and show you what I mean.”</em></p></section></section></section><section><h2>How to Answer 3 Most Common Behavioral Questions in an Interview [w/ Possible Answers]&nbsp;</h2><p>Finally, <strong>behavioral job interview questions</strong> are questions that focus on how you’ve performed in the past, or how you’d perform in a specific situation.</p><p>They’re used to understand your thinking patterns, and whether you can think on your feet.</p><p>Remember the STAR method we discussed all the way up? Well, it can be used to answer just about any behavioral interview questions.</p><p>To brush up your memory, the main idea behind the STAR method is that each answer should involve the following:</p><ul><li><strong>S: Situation</strong> - Set the scene and context.</li><li><strong>T: Task</strong> - Describe what your challenge or responsibility was.</li><li><strong>A: Action</strong> - List and dwell on all the actions you took towards addressing the challenge or responsibility.</li><li><strong>R: Result</strong> - Explain what the outcomes were and how they fit with the overall goal of the project or company.</li></ul><p>Here are 3 of the most common behavioral interview questions (with sample answers):</p><section><h3>1) Give an example of how you have handled a challenge in the workplace before.</h3><p>What the interviewers want to know in this case is how well you handle conflict and difficulties.</p><p>So, the answer here should be pretty straightforward.
